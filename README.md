### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**ameen**](https://ameen-showcase.vercel.app/), a  engineer based in India.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

My favorite tool is Figma, and I also enjoy using a variety of powerful developer tools. 

I work as a Full-Stack MERN Developer, focusing on building advanced and high-performance applications.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [Esthetic]([https://github.com/mirayatech/Anime-Scene-Gallery](https://github.com/ami-inn/esthetic)).

I’ve built over 30 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 50 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I have two cats
* I don’t like coffee or tea
* Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
* **Hobbies:** anime, series, movies, building things
